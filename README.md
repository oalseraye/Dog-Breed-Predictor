# Dog-Breed-Predictor

## Project Definition
This project lets you train your own dog breed predictor using deep learning and Keras framework and use it on dog images to predict its breed or a human images to get the closest breed to the image.
Or you can use a pre-trained model existing in saved_models folder with a 82% accuracy accross all dog breeds!!
The model is then deployed to a web application where you can test your own images!


## Analysis
The number of classes that the model can predict is 133 dog breeds. The below visualization shows the 


## Conclusion
We have trained our own dog breed predictor, then we have deployed it to a web application for us to predict our own images. One area of improvement for the over all accuracy is using more training data, another one is experimenting with different values for the hyperparameters (lr for example).
